# Project Reflection
Upon completion, I reflect on my experience, including lessons learned, challenges faced, and areas for improvement.

# Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in using the command line efficiently, allowing me to manage tasks and navigate through directories more effectively. Working with Git has provided me with a solid understanding of version control, enabling me to collaborate with others and keep track of changes.

I also sharpened my HTML skills while creating the recipe site. Understanding the importance of semantic HTML and proper structuring of content improved the accessibility and overall user experience of the site.

# Challenges Faced
Incorporating Flexbox into the project was both rewarding and challenging. While it enabled me to create a more dynamic layout that adapts to different screen sizes, I faced some hurdles in understanding the intricacies of Flexbox properties. However, with perseverance and reference to documentation, I successfully utilized Flexbox to achieve the desired responsive design.

# Areas for Improvement
